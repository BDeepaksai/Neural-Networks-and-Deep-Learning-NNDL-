# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-NNDL-
This repository contains my academic work for Neural Networks and Deep Learning, including implemented models, experiments. It covers perceptrons, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, and optimization techniques. The projects demonstrate practical understanding of core concepts through hands-on coding, visualizations, and performance evaluations.
